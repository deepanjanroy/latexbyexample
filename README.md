Latex by example
================

This is a personal reference repository of how-tos in Latex.

## Environment

Please install TeXLive and LatexTools for sublime. You will also need Skim (assuming you're on OS X), or a similar latextool supported pdf viewer.

## Viewing the examples

My personal workflow is to simply load a latex file into sublime text, and then build using latextools.  

## Learning Latex

The most fun way to do it is to read Knuth's texbook, and then read Lamport's Latex Manual, and then read up different documentations using `texdoc <package-name>`.
